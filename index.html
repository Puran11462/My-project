        <p class="lead">Surrey County Council will use AI to detect potholes and speed up road repairs, making the process more efficient and safer.</p>
        
        <h2>How it Works</h2>
        <p>Computer vision cameras fitted to dashboards in Surrey Highways vehicles will spot and photograph potholes, automatically recording them for repair.</p>
        
        <h3>Future Enhancements</h3>
        <p>Planned upgrades include detecting other road issues like missing signs and overgrown foliage, which will also be flagged for repair.</p>
        
        <blockquote>The council explained that highway inspectors would no longer need to step onto the road, making the process safer and more efficient.</blockquote>
        
        <h2>Investment and Goals</h2>
        <p>Matt Furniss, Surrey's cabinet member for highways, announced a <b>Â£300m investment</b> to improve the county's roads until 2028.</p>
